# The Reason I Made This Application

Mostly the reason that I made this application is to gain a deeper understanding of how SQL queries work and also to make an application that requires the user to give input and then use that input and put it into a database.

# Who This Application is For

This application could be for project managers that want to manage which employees are in which department and in which role. This could also be for C-Suite level executives that want to keep track of all of their employees with an employee tracker.

# Future Iterations of This Application

This application in the future may include an easier way to interface opposed to just using the command line. I find that this brings a barrier to entry because if you don't understand how to invoke the application it makes things harder.
